# SASS Color Palettes 

1500+ colors converted to SASS variables to help you use meaningful variable names.

The list was compiled by Chirag Mehta and can be used online at [http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) and converted to a list of SASS variables by [James Pearson](http://fearmediocrity.co.uk)
